School projects
These are some projects I have completed over my three semesters at UNF.  If you have any questions about specifics I am happy to answer them via email or phone at any time.  I have since learned how to improve some of them, specifically the ones written in C involving dynamic memory allocation with arrays and arrays of structs, and would happily expand on these projects.

The "src" file is a recent project i completed using java.  Basically takes in a list of names delimeted by commas with no spaces preceding or following the commas and gives options
to get specific information about the list of names.  I used a seperate class called "TwoD" to demonstrate my knowledge of working with objects.
